# Information Extraction for Protests

This project uses the [Odin extraction framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07513) to extract information about protests from text.

## How to compile the source code
This is a standard [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html) project, so use the usual commands (i.e. `sbt compile`, `sbt assembly`, etc.) to compile. To run the shell for grammar testing, run `./shell` from the command line.
