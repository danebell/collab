Goals: 
1. To extract information related to the demands of protests related to (1) international crises and (2) territorial disputes.
2. To extract information about protestor violence.
3. To extract information about government responses.

Examples:
At least <number> were killed and <number> were injured in <place> <when> during <violent?> protests against <topic>
Enraged about <topic>, <name>, a <occupation>, joined thousands of <people> in a rare <legal?> protest march on the streets of <place> <when>.
In the streets <when>, the protesters were objecting to <topic>.
Although the protests clearly had government support — large-scale public demonstrations are extremely rare in <place> — many people came on their own and appeared to be genuinely angered at <topic>.

Hard:
The police kept protesters separated into groups of 100 to 200 each; at the peak of the demonstration, in the early afternoon, streets were lined with at least 20 such groups.
